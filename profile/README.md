Bank more on the web platform and less on abstractions! - *Introducing the tooling, cloud, and community for web native development!*

## What We're Working On

-> **Tooling**: An ecosystem of technologies that explore new ways to go web-native! [Explore now](https://github.com/webqit/webqit).

-> **Community**: The *[WebQit Community](https://github.com/webqit/webqit#the-webqit-community)*, and the *[Web-Native (W3C) Community Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/web-native)* - an early-stage community group for web-native engineers. *[Join now](https://www.w3.org/community/web-native/join)*

-> **Cloud**: *Coming soon!*

## About the WebQit Project

WebQit is a focused initiative to explore new ways to leverage the web platform! We're drawing on learnings from the past decade to develop the tooling, cloud, and xommhnity for web native development.

We're big on web standards and are heavily invested in new technologies, proposals and polyfills that extend what's natively available.

## Motivation

Frameworks encode a lot of good thinking, but come at a non-trivial cost!

The web platform has in recent years evolved, but leaves much to be desired!

If we took some of that "good thinking" to the web platform itself, we would be having the best of both worlds! We're thus able to bank more on the platform and less on abstractions!

*Perhaps, this is the best way to move the web forward!*
