## What We're Working On

Web native tooling around the concept of `state`, `reactivity`, `data binding`, `routing`, `rendering`, the `component` model, the `SPA/MPA/MPA+SPA` architecture, and more.

## About the WebQit Project

WebQit is a focused initiative to explore new ways to leverage the web platform! We're drawing on learnings from the past decade to develop the tooling, cloud, and xommhnity for web native development.

We're big on web standards and believe that the best use of our time is to build new technologies that extend the standards, rather than obscure them. Our projects are therefore often of proposals and polyfills for new DOM and browser APIs that push the limits to what's possible natively.

## Motivation

Frameworks encode a lot of good thinking, but come at a price!

The web platform gives us much for free, but leaves much to be desired!

Web native tooling is how all of that good thinking find their way to the web platform! This helps everyone bank more on the platform and less on abstractions!

Perhaps, this is the best way to move the web forward!
